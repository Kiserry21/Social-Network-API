# Social-Network-API
This program is an API for a web-based social network application where users can express their ideas, respond to those of friends, and build a friend list. This backend, which can be utilized by social media start-ups, makes use of a NOSQL database, Express.js for routing, MongoDB for storage, and Mongoose ODM to handle sizable amounts of unstructured data, such as User and Thought models and schemas and Reaction subdocument schema. The server is launched and the Mongoose models are synced with the MongoDB database when the application is invoked.
